HOW COVID-19 HAS IMPACTED THE NUMBER OF NEW-BORNS

In this project, we aim to determine how covid has impacted population growth in countries worldwide. 
COVID-19 has had its fair share of impact on various sectors of the world, including but not limited to economic and financial stability, health, and other related development. 
We are going to understand the population effect on some of these sectors. For example, suppose there is a baby boom in an under-populated country. 
In that case, it will help in the proper application of underutilized resources and increased economic status since new ventures will be created because of the increase in the availability 
of labor. On the other hand, in a highly populated country, the baby boom will result in strains in various systems, so they need to have a proper plan to effectively use 
resources and labor.
